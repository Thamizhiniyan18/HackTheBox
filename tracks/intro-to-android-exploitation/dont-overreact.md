Let’s Start!!!!!!

## Initial Setup

First download and extract the given file.

Next I opened the apk with `jadx-gui`.

I checked the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and found that we need at least API version 21 to run this app and the target API version is 29 i.e., Android 10. So, I installed the app on Android 10 emulator.

It’s just a simple page with HackTheBox Logo.

## Code Analysis

Let’s take a look at the source code.

On taking a look at the `MainApplication` class file, we can see that its a React Native application.

React Native application usually stores all the javascript as a single bundle file under the assets directory. So let’s take a look at it.

In the `index.android.bundle`, file if you scroll down to the end, you can find a base64 encoded version of the flag. Copy that and decode it using CyberChef.

We have successfully obtained the flag……..

Thank You………
