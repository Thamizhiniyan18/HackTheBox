# Blue

## Overview

Hello everyone, In this blog we are going to solve Blue from HackTheBox.

Link for the machine : [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/51](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/51)

Lets Start ðŸ™Œ

Connect to the HTB server by using the OpenVpn configuration file thatâ€™s generated by HTB.

\[ [Click Here](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5185687-introduction-to-lab-access) to learn more about how to connect to vpn and access the boxes. ]

After connecting to the vpn service, click on Join Machine to access the machineâ€™s ip.

After joining the machine you can see the IP Address of the target machine.

## Reconnaissance

First I started by scanning for open ports on the target machine.

### Rustscan

The attack was successful and I got the meterpreter shell back. Now its time to find the flags.

## Getting the User Flag

Found the user flag at `C:\Users\haris\Desktop\user.txt`
